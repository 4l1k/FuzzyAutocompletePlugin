# FuzzyAutocomplete Plugin

This is a Xcode 5 plugin that patches the autocomplete filter to work the same way the `Open Quickly` works.

It performs very well, and the fuzzy matching actually uses Xcode's own `IDEOpenQuicklyPattern`.

## Features

* Gives Xcode's autocompletion to be able to filter like `Open Quickly` does
* Performs well
* Productivity++

## Installation

* [Download](https://github.com/chendo/FuzzyAutocompletePlugin/releases/download/v1.0/FuzzyAutocomplete.xcplugin.zip) and extract into `~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins`, or clone and build the project.
* Restart Xcode and enjoy!

## Notes

* Only tested with Xcode 5 on 10.9
